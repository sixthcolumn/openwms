This project depends on the epriConnect project for libraries, specifically the hibernate
libraries and mysql link. In order to build this project you first need to create a
jar file from the other project and then install it in your local maven repository.

1. Change to the epriConnect directory
1b. mvn package (to build everything)
2. mvn jar:jar (will create target/epriConnect.jar file)
3. run scripts/install-in-repo.sh (this will copy the jar into your local M2 repository)
4. if you're working in eclipse then change back to this base and do mvn eclipse:eclipse
   to add the repository to your current eclipse project
5. run mvn generate-sources (this will create EventState.java, which will need to be modified)
6. find and vi EventState.java and add the line
     @XmlRootElement
   above the class definition
6.b  and add import javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlRootElement;

7. to build a war that you can place in tomcat execute mvn package (will create target/*.war)


Testing

1. go up to step 6 in build above.
2. do mvn tomcat:run (project has a little tomcat starter/plugin that will start tomcat and deploy app)
3. run the junit test. It will create success/failure messages in the database
